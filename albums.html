            <div class="album-info">Rogue Introducer, Soul Enhancer is an 
                almost uncomfortably gorgeous piece of work. “Clumsy,” 
                the second single from the Stockholm producer Oli XL’s 
                striking debut LP, is a good distillation of the record’s 
                most memorable qualities. Working with a sound palette that 
                recalls humorless glitch recordings, it offers a demented 
                version of bliss that a listener could live with for a very 
                long time. The melancholy yet weirdly fun track is built 
                around a pair of freeze-dried chords and features a 
                pitched-up rendition of the iconic chorus from Beck’s 1993 
                single “Loser.” Where the original hook sounds like Sappho 
                on whippets, Oli XL makes the words mean something else. 
                Now they’re not just about a guy in a disorienting historical moment,
                but about everything, somehow. “Soy un perdedor. I’m a loser, 
                baby, so why don’t you kill me?” Next to Oli XL’s angelic 
                sound design, this comically profane request starts to 
                feel sacred.

            <br><button onclick="location.href='artists.html#babii'">going to artist?</button>
            <div class="album-info">The musical world BABii inhabits might be one defined by escapism, but few artists are able to combine a knack for world-building with deeply personal storytelling the way she does on MiiRROR. Opening up about her experience in a short personal essay titled ‘Smoke & Mirrors’, she imagines an “alternate reality where I have a mother” that is “carelessly utopian, an eternal bond, a warm touch, a loving understanding,” while at the same time recognizing that her journey “has forever been a labyrinth of bewildering emotions.” At its best, the album mirrors the “hazy ambivalence” of those conflicting impulses, even if it still retains an aura of mystery around the person behind the art. BABii floats about without reaching any clear resolution, but that might be the sound of fragments coming back together at the end of ‘MOTHER’. If there’s still a sense that something’s missing by the end, it at least comes with an understanding that you can’t always find a piece of yourself in someone else’s reflection.

            <br><button onclick="location.href='artists.html#arca'">going to artist?</button>
            <div class="album-info">This album began long before Alejandro Ghersi became Arca. In the nascent stages of his career, Ghersi made dreamy synth pop songs as a teenager in Venezuela under the name Nuuro. These love sketches, sung in Spanish and English, showcased an upbeat singing voice and brightly colored electronic landscapes redolent of Postal Service or Passion Pit. What he did as Nuuro and what he now does as Arca couldn’t seem any more different. Arca’s sound is one of chaos and contortions, further defined by the unsettling visuals of morphing bodies suspended in space he made with longtime collaborator Jesse Kanda. But when Ghersi debuted his newfound (or perhaps rediscovered) singing voice on Arca, it felt like a wormhole opened up—one that connected his prehistoric past to his visions of the distant future.</div>

            <br><button onclick="location.href='artists.html#aphextwin'">going to artist?</button>
            <div class="album-info">Drukqs showcases Aphex's crude instrumental contemplations to a fault. His production talents have their bounds, and they wear a little thin when he dons the mantle of artistic maturity, attempting to imitate Erik Satie. "Father," "Avril 14th," "Strotha Tynhe" and "Jynweythek Ylow" rove dangerously close to the Windham Hill new age aesthetic of the 80s.\t"Prep Gwarlek 3b" and "Kladfvgbung Micshk" take the formula to a more sophisticated, brooding level, but fail to bring anything exciting to a sound that Philip Glass pioneered more boldly 25 years ago. These languid noodlings comprise over half of the album; take them away and the cracks begin to show in Drukqs' monumental 30-song promise. In the end, with all the filler, this monster packs a lot less punch than some of Aphex's shorter releases, like the legendary Selected Ambient Works 85-92, or the Hangable Auto Bulb EPs.</div>
