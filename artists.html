            <div class="info">Daisy Warne, aka BABii, is a multidisciplinary artist, who resides in the United Kingdom and produces ethereal tracks that explore her feelings and inner demons, but also how to deal and heal from them. BABii tries to transport her audience to an alternate reality full of eerie, heartfelt, yet entrancing energies. She creates this atmospheric collision through experimenting with spacey instrumentals, cyborg electronica, and whisper-like lyrics.

            <div class="info">Aphex Twin is the most well-known alias of British electronic musician Richard D. James, who is widely considered a pioneer of IDM and electronic music in general. His sound is diverse, but is typically characterized by textured, ambient synth stylings, tight sampling, and pressing drum patterns. The pseudonym Aphex Twin is an homage both to the Aphex Systems Limited brand of audio equipment and to his older brother who died at birth.
